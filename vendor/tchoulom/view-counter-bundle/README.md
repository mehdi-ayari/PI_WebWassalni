The View Counter Bundle
========================

Welcome to the "**TchoulomViewCounterBundle**".

This bundle is used to count the number of views of a web page (the viewership).

This bundle can also be used to draw a graphical representation of statistical data of the web pages.

# Installation

## Step 1: Download TchoulomViewCounterBundle using composer

 You can install it via Composer:

  ``` bash
  $ php composer.phar update tchoulom/view-counter-bundle
  ```
   or
 ``` bash
  $ composer require tchoulom/view-counter-bundle
  ```
   or
  ``` bash
   $ composer req tchoulom/view-counter-bundle
   ```

  Check that it is recorded in the **composer.json** file
  
  ```js
  {
      "require": {
          ...
          "tchoulom/view-counter-bundle": ">=3.0"
          ...
      }
  }
  ```
## Step 2: Enable the Bundle

Edit the **appKernel.php** file

```php
    ...
    $bundles = array(
	     ...
	     new Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\TchoulomViewCounterBundle(),
	     ...
      );
     ...
```

# Usage

## Step 1: Interface and Property

Suppose that you have an **Article** Entity.

This Entity must implement the **ViewCountable** interface:

```php
   use Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\Model\ViewCountable;
   
    ...
    class Article implements ViewCountable
    {
      ...
    }
```
Add the **$views** property and the target Entity **ViewCounter**.

The **$views** property allows to get the number of views:

```php
   use Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\Model\ViewCountable;
   use Entity\ViewCounter;
   use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
    ...
    class Article implements ViewCountable
    {
      ...
      /**
       * @ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity="Entity\ViewCounter", mappedBy="article")
       */
      protected $viewCounters;
          
      /**
      * @ORM\Column(name="views", type="integer", nullable=true)
      */
       protected $views = 0;
       
       /**
        * Constructor
        */
       public function __construct()
       {
           $this->viewCounters = new ArrayCollection();
       }
       
       /**
        * Sets $views
        *
        * @param integer $views
        *
        * @return $this
        */
       public function setViews($views)
       {
           $this->views = $views;
   
           return $this;
       }
   
       /**
        * Gets $views
        *
        * @return integer
        */
       public function getViews()
       {
           return $this->views;
       }
       
       /**
        * Get $viewCounters
        *
        * @return Collection
        */
       public function getViewCounters()
       {
           return $this->viewCounters;
       }
   
       /**
        * Add $viewCounter
        *
        * @param ViewCounter $viewCounter
        *
        * @return $this
        */
       public function addViewCounter(ViewCounter $viewCounter)
       {
           $this->viewCounters[] = $viewCounter;
   
           return $this;
       }
   
       /**
        * Remove $viewCounter
        *
        * @param ViewCounter $viewCounter
        */
       public function removeViewCounter(ViewCounter $viewCounter)
       {
           $this->viewCounters->removeElement($viewCounter);
       }
      ...
    }
```

## Step 2: ViewCounter

The **ViewCounter** Entity allows to set the IP address, the **view_date**, and the **article_id**.

The **ViewCounter** Entity must extend the **BaseViewCounter**:

```php

    use Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\Entity\ViewCounter as BaseViewCounter;
    
    /**
     * ViewCounter.
     *
     * @ORM\Table(name="view_counter")
     * @ORM\Entity()
     */
    class ViewCounter extends BaseViewCounter
    {
        ...
    }

```

Update the doctrine relationship between the **ViewCounter** Entity and your **Article** Entity:

```php

    use Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\Entity\ViewCounter as BaseViewCounter;
    
    /**
     * ViewCounter.
     *
     * @ORM\Table(name="view_counter")
     * @ORM\Entity()
     */
    class ViewCounter extends BaseViewCounter
    {
        ...
        
        /**
         * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="Article", cascade={"persist"}, inversedBy="viewCounters")
         * @ORM\JoinColumn(nullable=true)
         */
        private $article;
    
        /**
         * Gets article
         *
         * @return Article
         */
        public function getArticle()
        {
            return $this->article;
        }
    
        /**
         * Sets Article
         *
         * @param Article $article
         *
         * @return $this
         */
        public function setArticle(Article $article)
        {
            $this->article = $article;
    
            return $this;
        }
        
        ...
    }

```
## Step 3: Configuration

Add the following configuration in the configuration file:

```yaml

    tchoulom_view_counter:
        view_counter:
            view_strategy: daily_view
        statistics:
            use_stats: false
            stats_file_name: stats
            stats_file_extension:

```
### The "view_counter"

The different values of ***view_strategy*** are : daily_view, unique_view, increment_each_view, hourly_view, weekly_view, monthly_view, yearly_view, view_per_minute, view_per_second.

* The **daily_view** allows to increment **daily**, for a given **IP** address, the number of views of an **Article** (the viewership).
In fact it increments the **$views** property.

* The **unique_view** allows to set to **1**, for a given **IP** address, the number of view of an article

* The **increment_each_view** allows to increment the number of views of an **Article** every time the user will refresh the page

* The **hourly_view** allows to increment **hourly**, for a given **IP** address, the number of views of an **Article** (the viewership).

* The **weekly_view** allows to increment **weekly**, for a given **IP** address, the number of views of an **Article** (the viewership).

* The **monthly_view** allows to increment **monthly**, for a given **IP** address, the number of views of an **Article** (the viewership).

* The **yearly_view** allows to increment **yearly**, for a given **IP** address, the number of views of an **Article** (the viewership).

* The **view_per_minute** allows to increment **every minute**, for a given **IP** address, the number of views of an **Article** (the viewership).

* The **view_per_second** allows to increment **every second**, for a given **IP** address, the number of views of an **Article** (the viewership).

### The "statistics"

The **use_stats** allows to indicate if you want to use statistics.

If **use_stats** is set to ***true***, statistics functionality will be used (confers the ***Step 6***).

The **stats_file_name** allows to define the name of the statistics file.

The default name of **stats_file_name** is **stats**

The **stats_file_extension** allows to define the extension of the statistics file.

**Example :**

If **stats_file_extension: txt**, then the default name of the statistics file will be ***stats.txt***

If **stats_file_extension:**, then the default name of the statistics file will be ***stats***

The full path of the statistics file is ***var/viewcounter*** of your project.

## Step 4: The Controller

2 methods are available:

### Method 1

Recommendation: You can use the **Symfony kernel terminate listener** to set the Viewcounter

```php
use App\Entity\ViewCounter;
...

/**
 * Reads an existing article
 *
 * @Route("/read/{id}", name="read_article")
 * @ParamConverter("article", options={"mapping": {"id": "id"}})
 * @Method({"GET", "POST"})
 */
 public function readAction(Request $request, Article $article)
 {
    // Viewcounter
    $viewcounter = $this->get('tchoulom.viewcounter')->getViewCounter($article);
    $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getEntityManager();
    
    if ($this->get('tchoulom.viewcounter')->isNewView($viewcounter)) {
        $views = $this->get('tchoulom.viewcounter')->getViews($article);
        $viewcounter->setIp($request->getClientIp());
        $viewcounter->setArticle($article);
        $viewcounter->setViewDate(new \DateTime('now'));
    
        $article->setViews($views);
    
        $em->persist($viewcounter);
        $em->persist($article);
        $em->flush();
    }
 }
...
```

### Method 2

You only need to save your **Article** Entity via the **'tchoulom.viewcounter'** service:

```php
...
/**
 * Reads an existing article
 *
 * @Route("/read/{id}", name="read_article")
 * @ParamConverter("article", options={"mapping": {"id": "id"}})
 * @Method({"GET", "POST"})
 */
public function readAction(Request $request, Article $article)
{
    // Saves the view
    $page = $this->get('tchoulom.viewcounter')->saveView($article);
}
...
```

The second method returns the current page ($article).

You can choose the method that is most appropriate for your situation.

## Step 5: The View

Finally you can display the number of views:

```twig
...
<h1>The number of views of this article :</h1> {{ article.views }}
...
```

## Step 6: Exploitation of statistical data

### The *StatsFinder* service

Use the **StatsFinder** service to get statistics of a web page :

```php
   // The "statsFinder" service
   $statsFinder = $this->get('tchoulom.viewcounter.stats_finder');
   
   // Get all statistical data
   $contents = $statsFinder->loadContents();
   
   // Finds statistics by page
   // Returns an instance of Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\Statistics\Page
   $page = $statsFinder->findByPage($article);
    
   // Finds statistics by year (year number: 2019)
   // Returns an instance of Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\Statistics\Year
   $year = $statsFinder->findByYear($article, 2019);
     
   // Finds statistics by month (month number: 1)
   // Returns an instance of Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\Statistics\Month
   $month = $statsFinder->findByMonth($article, 2019, 1);
   
   // Finds statistics by week (week number: 3)
   // Returns an instance of Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\Statistics\Week
   $week = $statsFinder->findByWeek($article, 2019, 1, 3);
   
   // Finds statistics by day (name of the day: 'thursday')
   // Returns an instance of Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\Statistics\Day
   $day = $statsFinder->findByDay($article, 2019, 1, 3, 'thursday');
   
   // Finds statistics by hour (time name: 'h17' => between 17:00 and 17:59)
   // Returns an instance of Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\Statistics\Hour
   $hour = $statsFinder->findByHour($article, 2019, 1, 3, 'thursday', 'h17');
   
   // Finds statistics by minute (the name of the minute: 'm49' => in the 49th minute)
   // Returns an instance of Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\Statistics\Minute
   $minute = $statsFinder->findByMinute($course, 2019, 1, 3, 'thursday', 'h17', 'm49');
   
   // Finds statistics by second (the name of the second: 's19' => in the 19th second)
   // Returns an instance of Tchoulom\ViewCounterBundle\Statistics\Second
   $second = $statsFinder->findBySecond($course, 2019, 1, 3, 'thursday', 'h17', 'm49', 's19');
   
```

You can also get statistical data of a web page by **year**, **month**, **week**, **day**, **hour**, **minute** and **second**

The data in the stats file represents the view statistics, as shown in the following figure:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tchoulom/ViewCounterBundle/master/Resources/doc/images/statistical-data-2018.png" alt="Statistical data in 2018" align="center" />

The figure above shows that the statistical data contain 2 "viewcountable" entities: **article** and **news**.

The statistical data of the entity **article** are recorded over 12 months.

Let's zoom in on the statistics for the first week of January:

### The *StatsComputer* service

Use the **StatsComputer** service to calculate the min value, max value, average value, range value, mode value, median value and the number of occurrences of the statistics :

First of all, get the stats computer service

```php
   $statsComputer = $this->get('tchoulom.viewcounter.stats_computer');
```

The functions of the **statsComputer** service can take as argument the *$yearlyStats*, *$monthlyStats*, *$weeklyStats*, *$daylyStats*, *$hourlyStats*, *$statsPerMinute*, and *$statsPerSecond*

#### Calculates the *min value*

```php
   // Get the min value of the yearly statistics
   $minValue = $statsComputer->computeMinValue($yearlyStats);
```

Result:
```php
    [2017,47882376]
```

#### Calculates the *max value*

```php
   // Get the max value of the monthly statistics
   $maxValue = $statsComputer->computeMaxValue($monthlyStats);
```

Result:
```php
    [8,951224]
```

#### Calculates the *average*

The **average** is the sum of the values ​​of the statistical series divided by the number of values.

```php
   // Get the average of the weekly statistics
   $average = $statsComputer->computeAverage($weeklyStats);
```

Result:
```php
    265039
```

#### Calculates the *range*

The **range** is the difference between the highest number and the lowest number.

```php
   // Get the range of the daily statistics
   $range = $statsComputer->computeRange($dailyStats);
```

Result:
```php
    6
```

#### Calculates the *mode*

The **mode** is the number that is in the array the most times.

```php
   // Get the mode of the hourly statistics
   $mode = $statsComputer->computeMode($hourlyStats);
```

Result:
```php
    700
```

#### Calculates the *median*

The **median** is the middle value after the numbers are sorted smallest to largest.

```php
   // Get the median of the statistics per minute
   $median = $statsComputer->computeMedian($statsPerMinute);
```

Result:
```php
    75.5
```

#### Count the number of values ​​in the statistical series

```php
   // Get the count of the statistics per second
   $count = $statsComputer->count($statsPerSecond);
```

Result:
```php
    60
```
